Palette Picker lets you sort through the colors of the rainbow to find pleasing combinations. Lock colors that you like until you pick a perfectly presented palette. 

Colors choices are saved to a project on the backend server so you can come back anytime. Also supports multiple projects with projects able to save multiple palettes.
